# Movie Search App

The Movie Search App is a web application built with React that allows users to search for information about movies and TV shows. Users can browse a vast database of movies, view detailed information about each movie, and even save their favorite movies for future reference.



## Features

- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies and TV shows by title, genre, actor, or director.
- **Movie Details:** Detailed information about each movie, including cast, plot summary, release date, and user ratings.
- **Save Favorites:** Users can create an account and save their favorite movies for quick access.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication for saving favorite movies.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router for navigation
- The Movie Database (TMDb) API for movie data
- Firebase for user authentication and data storage
- [Your additional technologies here]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
- An API key from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for fetching movie data.
- A Firebase project set up for user authentication and data storage.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-search-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-search-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your API key and Firebase configuration:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your-tmdb-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
2. Use the search bar to find movies and TV shows.
3. Click on a movie or TV show to view its details.
4. Sign up or log in to save your favorite movies.
5. Enjoy exploring and discovering new movies!
